Hello Elastonians!

This is your friend Mahadev Vasireddy. I really feel glad to be part of this huge project at this root level. And I would like to make many more people to experience the emotion and happiness that i am experiencing right now.
That is why I decided to join Elastos team to make my dreams to come true and to make others to start dreaming big.
 
Coming to my Introduction, I am a senior student here at Penn state, USA. I am pursuing my dream major Computer science.
I have been part of Ela community for last 4 months and tried with my best of my abilities to help people to get to know what this Elastos is all about. Some where in this journey, I myself fell in love with ELA team and community and how well organised they are. Now I decided that its time for me to be an actual community builder than just answering to questions like "When Binance?!". I will keep you guys informed about how i am going to pursue my "building community" mission in the most effective ways possible.

As an Indian by birth, I would like to concentrate on building Indian community specifically. As I strongly think, Indian IT sector is a super gaint and I have some resources to communicate effectively with that giant. Feel free to email me any concerns and questions.

Mahadev Vasireddy.
