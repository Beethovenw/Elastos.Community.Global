I would like to start holding monthly meetups talking about Elastos and/or giving presentations on the Elastos ecosystem. I will try to rent a small place where we can hangout and talk about everything Elastos related and maybe even have some live-working sessions with building some demo dapps and analyzing the Elastos code and how we can make it better as an open-source community.
